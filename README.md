### Important
Because the trained models are not included, during the first run all models will be trained so it can take some time.
Also during the training you will be able to see the acurracy and false positive rate of each algorithm.
After the first run, all models will be available.

### Testing

Images **image_exe.png , image_no_header_file.png , image_pdf.png** are available 
for testing the main part of this project, the **Analysis of picture**.

Besides, feel free to play around and suggest ideas for a possible upgrade.
